# *What am I looking at?*
Take it easy! If you're looking for a low profile SCSI adapter then you've found an "easy" option. Even better? It's open source and [open hardware](https://oshwlab.com/stephenarsenault/scsi50-to-db25). The overeasy II converts 50 Pin SCSI male connectos to DB25 male.

*Take a look at how small the overeasy II is on a [BlueSCSI](https://github.com/erichelgeson/BlueSCSI)!*
